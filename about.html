    <h1>Hello! This is the about page</h1>
    <h2>About this website</h2>
    <p>This is a personal website designed for my database systems lab. The goal of this assignment is to learn HTML and CSS, as well as integrate them and create a well-designed website. To create this website, I started by creating a new project in Netbeans IDE. After my project was made, I started creating multiple HTML files (one for every page of this website), and one style CSS file to layout the style of every HTML page.</p>
    <h2>What I did</h2>
    <p>Like I said before, I made an HTML file for every page on this website. In every HTML file, I included a link to the CSS file that has the style guidelines for each HTML page. Some things I added to the CSS file were the background color, centering certain text, coloring text, the navigation bar, and a few more details. </p>
    <h2>What I used</h2>
    <p>To create some features of this website, I needed a little bit of help, so I used some online resources to help out. To create the navigation bar, I got some help from this source <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">here</a>. Once I got the generic navigation bar working, I went back in to change the color and size it differently to my liking. On the contact page there is a Google map of my contact location. I used this source <a href="https://google-map-generator.com/">here</a> to embed the HTML code, since this was a tricker part.</p>
    <h2>How to Navigate</h2>
    <p>This website has multiple features:
    <ul>
        <li>HOME</li>
        <li>ABOUT</li>
        <li>CONTACT</li>
        <li>PORTFOLIO</li>
        <li>SIGN UP</li>
        <li>SIGN IN</li>
        <li>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</li>
        <li>PRIVACY POLICY</li>
        <li>COOKIE POLICY</li>
    </ul>
    The navigaton bar at the top of the website is clearly labeled to help guide you through the website</p>
    <h2>About Each Page</h2>
    <p>There are nine pages on this website. The home page is just a home page. The about page is this page and tells you what this website is about. The contact page has my contact information. The portfolio page has my academic and professional materials. The sign up and sign in are options to login or register. The footer features are self-explanatory.</p>
