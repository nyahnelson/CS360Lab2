    <h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
    <p>I am currently a junior studying computer science with minors in mathematics and Spanish. I have two and half years of experience, and have worked on many projects. I am currently working on a database systems project, where I am learning new software tools and computational concepts. All of my education and experience is clearly outlined in my resume. Click <a href="/Users/nyahnelson/Downloads/Resume%20(1).pdf">here</a> for a link to my resume</p>
    <h2> EDUCATION </h2>
    <p>I have been studying computer science for two and a half years, and I am going on my second semester of my junior year. I have taken classes on data structures, algorithms, database systems, machine learning, programming languages, and a few technical electives. I have taken numerous math courses inclduing calculus 2, calculus 3, discrete math, linear algebra, theory of computation, and analysis of algorithms. </p>
    <h2> EXPERIENCE </h2>
    <p>I work as a computer science tutor at my university. I assist students who need assistance with their lower division computer science classes, and I also attend labs to answer any questions and help students get comfortable with the software. This has improved my proficiency in programming languages as well as develop soft skills. </p>
    <h2> PROJECTS </h2>
    <p>I have worked on a few big projects in the past few years. In my software engineering course, I worked on a team of seven for a semester long project to develop a full functional video game. For this project, I worked on Unity game engine and used GIT version control system to upload my source code. I am currently working on a team of 3 to develop a database system to create a smart academic advising system.</p>
